                    <h2>A Star Emerges</h2>
                    <p>
                        This week our Siege team took to week 4 with a lot of momentum coming out of a nailbiting near come from behind series against Trinity Valley. Still currently without 
                        their first win, the team is making great strides and showing constant improvement. Facing down a dangerous Hutch CC team, JCC went into this match with the intent of 
                        showing they were no pushover themselves. The Jagaurs have yet to find their identity as a team, yet every week tends to show more and more potential. With some standout
                        performance, flawless rounds, and a complete destruction in Game 2, JCC is poised to make a huge step into the National Spotlight in the coming months.   
                    </p>
                    <h2>Game 1</h2>
                    <p>
                        Game 1 saw the Jags and Blue Dragons meeting on Clubhouse, a popular pick by JCC and one of their strongest maps. Coming into this game Danny "WhiteAssassin"
                        Jones, the Team Captain for Rainbow, had made strict preparations for site control and contention. The Jags have struggled on the attacking side this season and looked to make
                        a statement to both themselves and their opponent. Through the first two rounds, Hutch CC held strong on the defensive side going up 2-0 early. The Blue Dragons were led by
                        Civvy, a very strong and aggressive player who hunts down his opponents with reckless abandon. The standout player from Hutch led his team to an early 5-1 lead reaching double
                        digit kills within the first half. The final round saw Hutch player "Riles" clutch a 1v4, providing huge momentum going into their attacking side. JCC struggled to find a foothole, 
                        unable to even get into site. They were led by Noah at the halfway mark with 8 kills. <br><br>

                        <iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=BlatantDarlingDuckEagleEye-CGz_XKkmlSAX0ZIr&parent=www.jaguar-esports.com" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>
                       
                        <br><br>
                        The Jags showed some life on the defensive side, winning the initial round to put the score at 2-5. Both teams had players step up in the proceeding rounds. The trio of "Civvy", 
                        "Earthly", and "Riles" combined for 30 kills going into the Match Point frame. A strong hold from Johnston pushed the game to another match point. With the win in sights, Hutch made
                        this round count, closing out JCC and taking the first game 7-3. Whether this was the norm for those 3 mentioned Hutch players or a fluke, the Jaguars needed an answer in Game 2.

                        <br><br>
                    </p>
                    <h2>Game 2</h2>
                    <p>
                        Game 2 was played on Skyscraper, the map of choice for the Blue Dragons. This was not a very familiar map for the Jags, and is not often played in general among competitive settings.
                        Something seemed to click for the Jaguars on this unfamiliar map. The team was playing together, trading out kills, and holding site strongly. Having chosen the defensive side first, JCC
                        took a split half going into their attacking phase tied all at 3-3. Having struggled on the attacking side, this was a definitive moment as to whether this team can compete on both sides 
                        of the game. While the scoreboard would indicate that Noah "ConfirmedGuy" Netter was a man among boys, the entire team cam to play in the second half. Multiple rounds of each player getting
                        kills to secure the round win. Chipper "Yeti" Starling, Jessica "Jess" Tovar, Cameron "GrandpaJoe" Langston, and Danny "WhiteAssassin" Jones all made plays to go along with Noah's 15-4 game. 
                        This appeared to be a breakout game for the newest member of the Rainbow Six roster. JCC took a strong Match Point lead at 6-3, eventually sealing the deal on a flawless performance winning the 
                        game 7-4. Hunting for their first win of the season, the Jags were poised to steal a seemingly out of reach series just two weeks ago.
                        <br><br>
                    </p>
                    <h2>Game 3</h2>
                    <p>
                        Game 3 came into everyones mind with high expectations. Beating Hutch on their map of choice gave a lot of momentum to the Jags going into the deciding match. This game would unfortunately not
                        go in their favor. With the teams starring down an Oregon decider, a map the Jags are very familiar with, all of the wind was seemingly sucked out of their sails. The Jaguars came out flat as the 
                        Blue Dragons showed no sign of slowing down. Riles continued to dominate the game, leading Hutch to a very quick 6-0 lead going 10-3 into the second half. With their backs against the wall, the
                        Jags managed to pull out a round to force a second match point. It was here, on Laundry room site, that the Bue Dragons slammed the door on the first potential win for JCC on the season. With so 
                        much potential shown, the question lingers on if this team will get over the hump. No doubt that the player skill is there, they simply need to put it together and finally show the true level at 
                        which they can play.

                    <h2>Player Interviews</h2>
                    <p>
                        Following the series, I took the time to reach out to the players for their thoughts about how the games went, what they can improve on, and how their mindeset is shifting heading into the final
                        stretch of the season:
                        <br><br>
                        
                        <h3>Danny "WhiteAssassin" Jones</h3>
                        <p>
                            <em>Do you think Noah stood out this week in regards to his fragging ability, how does that factor into you guys ability to create plays?</em>
                            <br><br>
                            I feel like Noah played excellent, and he has really stepped up for this being his first season. The team itself has made big improvements and I think that is attributed to just better teamwork.
                            Playing off one another, playing trades, and our chemistry outside of the game has done a lot for us as a Team
                            <br><br>
                            <em>Going into the next two weeks against very good teams, how do you feel like you guys stack up right now and how does that effect your playoff chances?</em>
                            <br><br>
                            Going into the next two weeks, we got to get more practice in. Also, I feel like we need to mix it up a little bit to beat these next two teams. With the final three weeks we need to win out to 
                            have a chance at playoffs, we just need to take it one game at a time.
                            <br><br>
                        </p>
                        <h3>Noah "ConfirmedGuy" Netter</h3>
                        <p>
                            <em>What was your mindset going into game 3 after your 15-4 performance on the enemy map choice?</em>
                            <br><br>
                            My mindset during the second game was mainly focusing on Intel and the team call-outs. I believe Intel is key to Rainbow Six.
                            <br><br>
                            <em>Do you feel as if the team looks to you for your ability to create space by fragging out?</em>
                            <br><br>
                            I feel the team is now looking at me to clear some parts of the space. I can't do the fragging alone, so I rely on teammates for Intel of where enemies might be lurking.
                            <br><br>
                            <em>Does the team, in your eyes, seem to be on an upward trajectory in terms of performance?</em>
                            <br><br>
                            I do see our performance getting incredibly better each game. Each player is increasing their strategy of the game, which I find satisfying to see the improvement.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Chipper "Yeti" Starling</h3>
                        <p>
                            <em>How are you seeing improvement throughout the team in the past two weeks considering you guys have made a huge jump in gameday performance?</em>
                            <br><br>
                            We are becoming one of if not the best lock down defensive teams in the conference. I can tell off of how we dealt with Skyscraper tonight and how even 
                            with out a basic scheme there was still a solid structure to defense.
                            <br><br>
                            <em>How do you view Danny's insight when it comes to strategy? Has detailed practice regiment and strategy been a contributing factor for you guys as a team?</em>
                            <br><br>
                            Danny is the mad genius. He is solely our strategist he is the reason we have made these improvements. Overall a great leader.
                            <br><br>
                            <em>Would you say Noah has stepped into the situation and taken it in stride, seemingly becoming the star player or the team overnight?</em>
                            <br><br>
                            Noah seems to have been the missing puzzle piece. We all have a more support player background and it is nice to finally have someone who is more of that 
                            dedicated fragger role. He instantly clicked with the team which is solid too.
                            <br><br>
                            <em>What adjustments need to be made to have a perfect season ending run and maybe make playoffs?</em>
                            <br><br>
                            OUR ATTACK. I cannot stress enough Attack is our weakest thing in the game. At this point we just need 2 wins and we win. So now we need to find ways to so that.
                            <br><br>

                    <p>
                        Playoffs are finally over, and with that the spring season is too. We all had a blast playing and look forward to competing again in the summer and fall.
                        With that being said, Let's talk about playoff results: <br><br>
                        JCC Rocket League defeated Dallas Eastfield 3-1 in the first round before falling 0-3 to the NOVA Nighthawks. The Nighthawks went on to win the entire tournament,
                        claiming their second straight national title for Rocket League.
                        Over in the 1v1 competition, pancake423 was able to win the NJCAAe National Championship in 1v1, defeating rlREMIX of Madison CC 3-0 in the finals.
                        JCC's first title win ended with a bang, as pancake scored this goal to secure the sweep: <br><br>

                        <br><br>
                        In Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Jonathan took his first three matches before losing in the quarterfinals to Tony M. of Iowa Western, who went on to win the entire tournament.
                        Both Rocket League and Smash ran in to some extremely tough opponents early on in the bracket, but we had a great season regardless with many performances to be proud of.
                        
                    </p>
                    <h2>The Future</h2>
                    <p>
                        On Monday, May 16th (and spilling over into Tuesday), JCC E-sports will be hosting a 24 hour variety stream on our twitch channel. It will be a fun mix of competition,
                         entertainment, and general chaos as the players take over the e-sports room for an entire day.

                        <br><br>
                        In the summer interim, JCC will compete in the GenerationEsports Collegiate Summer Series for a share of $30,000 in scholarship money. The team will continue to practice
                        and improve moving in to the fall season. Watch out for the addition of a Valorant team to our roster!

                        The spring 2022 season is finally coming to a close, with regular season games ending on Friday, April 15th.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Rocket League</h3>
                    <p>
                      Rocket League ended the season full steam ahead, placing second in the CVCC LAN and winning $300. Additionally, the team qualified for NJCAA playoffs as the #7 seed, where
                      they will be taking on the #10 seed Dallas Eastfield on April 18th at 8:00pm. The team captain pancake423 will also be competing in the NJCAA 1v1 open, facing off against Blirry (from Wake Tech. Gold)
                      on April 18th at 6:00pm.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Smash</h3>
                    <p>Jonathan (3Mario465) was the only smash player to make playoffs, qualifying as a wildcard with a 7-2 record. Both of his losses were close and competitive, and he is a strong dark-horse candidiate
                    to make a deep playoff run. His first match is against Rockland CC at 7pm on April 19th.</p>
                    <h3>Overwatch</h3>
                    <p>JCC lost their final overwatch game of the season on Friday, losing 3-0 to Dallas College: North Lake. In tragic fashion, this loss put us at 4th in the group and eliminated the team from
                    playoff contention. JCC still finished with a strong 6-3 record, but with playoffs being reduced from 16 teams to 8, we no longer made the cutoff.</p>

                        <h3>Overwatch</h3>
                        <p>
                            JCC Overwatch swept Grays Harbor College in the final game of week 1. Overwatch was hot from the start and never looked back, taking Lijang Tower 2-0, Hollywood 1-0, and then Hanamura 1-0 to close out the match.
                            The Jaguars' defense held strong on the final two maps, not giving up a single objective.

                            Two games were streamed this week: Rocket League on Monday, and Overwatch on Friday. I went ahead and clipped my favorite moment from each stream:

                            I'm not sure about the ethics of this, but here's a really nice goal I scored in game 2 of the Rocket League match: <br>
