                        Rocket League swept Alpena Community College (2-2) to move to 4-0 on the season. In a reversal of the usual pattern, game 1 and 2 were convincing wins
                        and game 3 went into a close overtime. Tragically, we accidentally ended our stream right before the final goal was scored.

                        <h3>Rocket League</h3>
                        <p>On Monday, Rocket league kicked off the season with a great performance, defeating Utah State University Eastern in a convincing 3-0 sweep. After a slow start that saw game one tied 2-2 with 3:00 remaining, The Jaguars pulled ahead and never looked back.
                            <br><br>Game scores:<br> Game 1: 6-2<br> Game 2: 10-0 <br> Game 3: 6-1
                        </p>
                        <h3>Rainbow Six</h3>
                        <p>
                            For their season opener, rainbow six faced off against the Hocking College Hawks. JCC took a tough 1-2 loss.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Smash</h3>
                        <p>
                            JCC Smash had a mixed bag of results for their opening week. 
                            Jonathan and Justin both Swept, while Lamont and Ty both lost their respective matches. Daniel's opponent no-showed the match and he was given a win by Forefeit. Nick was unable to make his game and took an FF loss.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Overwatch</h3>
                        <p>
                            JCC Overwatch swept Grays Harbor College in the final game of week 1. Overwatch was hot from the start and never looked back, taking Lijang Tower 2-0, Hollywood 1-0, and then Hanamura 1-0 to close out the match.
                            The Jaguars' defense held strong on the final two maps, not giving up a single objective.

                            Two games were streamed this week: Rocket League on Monday, and Overwatch on Friday. I went ahead and clipped my favorite moment from each stream:

                            I'm not sure about the ethics of this, but here's a really nice goal I scored in game 2 of the Rocket League match: <br>
